--Measures--

The decomposed data complexity measures can be grouped in: 
(1) feature overlapping measures, 
(2) neighborhood measures, 
(3) linearity measures.



-Measures of overlapping-

F1: Fisher's discriminant ratio
F2: Overlapping of the per-class bounding boxes
F3: Maximum individual feature efficiency
F4: Cllective feature efficiency


-Measures of neighborhood information-

N1: Fraction of points lying on the class boundary
N2: Average intra/inter class nearest neighbor distances
N3: Leave-one-out error rate of the 1-nearest neighbor algorithm
N4: Nonlinearity of the one-nearest neighbor classifier
T1: Fraction of maximum covering spheres on data


-Measures of linearity-

L1: Distance of erroneous instances to a linear classifier
L2: Training error of a linear classifier
L3: Nonlinearity of a linear classifier
